Exploring some bitwise operations in C. Create an executable program called bits which reads an integer value from the user, using the readInt() function. Then, ask the user if they want to set, unset, or flip a bit inside this number. No matter which of the three options the user selects, you will need to read in another integer (in the range 0 to 31) to determine which bit to change. Finally, print out the number after the single bit change has happened.
